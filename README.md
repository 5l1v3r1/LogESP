# LogDissect Security Intelligence
A web application for managing security information. Still in early development.

## Applications
LDSI applications:
- Assets - Asset Management
- Risk - Risk Management (based on [NIST SP 800-30r1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final))
- SIEM - Security Information and Event Management

## Design Principles
### [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) guidelines
The LDSI risk management system is based on NIST [risk management](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final) guidelines, and the SIEM and forensics apps are designed to support the NIST [incident response](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) and [forensics](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-86/final) guidelines.

### Simplicity
LDSI embraces the Unix design philosophy. It is designed to be as simple as possible, in order to be easy to understand, use, maintain, and extend.

## Installing
